# Big_Data_Technologies_4130_Project

## Summary
This semester-long project goal was to learn how to use PySpark on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster to build a machine learning pipeline that consists of several steps to predict the price of a flight ticket using linear regression. The data underwent preprocessing to impute null values and drop unnecessary columns. Data visualizations were created to explore feature relationships and analyze model performance. The technologies used for the project include Google Cloud Platform, PySpark, and Python. This pipeline is created and stored on a Google Cloud instance and Dataproc cluster.

This pipeline, which includes the cleaned data, feature-engineered dataset, and trained models, is developed within a Jupyter Notebook on a Dataproc cluster and stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

This project report breaks the project down into 6 milestones:

Milestone 1: Project Proposal  

Milestone 2: Data Acquisition  

Milestone 3: Descriptive Statistics (EDA)  

Milestone 4: Feature Engineering and Modeling  

Milestone 5: Visualizing Results
